Overview
========
The flexspi_nor_edma_transfer example shows how to use flexspi driver with dma:

In this example, flexspi will send data and operate the external nor flash connected with FLEXSPI. Some simple flash command will
be executed, such as Write Enable, Erase sector, Program page.
Example will first erase the sector and program a page into the flash, at last check if the data in flash is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCX-N9XX-BRK board
- Personal Computer
- USB to serial converter

Board settings
==============
USB to serial converter connect pin:
    J2-60 - TX of USB to serial converter
    J2-59 - RX of USB to serial converter 
    J2-70 - GND of USB to serial converter 

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a MCU-LINK or JLINK with DEBUG PORT(J4) and connect a micro USB cable with USB port(J3) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
