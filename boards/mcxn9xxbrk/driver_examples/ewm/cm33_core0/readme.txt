Overview
========
The EWM Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK EWM driver.
In the example, EWM counter is continuously refreshed until button is pressed.
Once the button is pressed, EWM counter will expire and interrupt will be generated.
After the first pressing, another interrupt can be triggered by pressing button again.

Note: In flash boot mode, if you want to use the IDE reset program, please use systemReset.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a MCU-LINK or JLINK with DEBUG PORT(J4) and connect a micro USB cable with USB port(J3) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.
