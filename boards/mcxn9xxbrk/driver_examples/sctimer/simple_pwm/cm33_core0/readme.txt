Overview
========
The SCTimer project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK SCTimer's driver capabiltiy to generate PWM signals.
The SCTimer project enables a 32-bit counter to output two center-aligned PWM signals with parameters set to 24kHz frequency.
The duty cycles of the two PWM signals are 50% and 20%, respectively.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCX-N9XX-BRK board
- Personal Computer
- USB to serial converter

Board settings
==============
USB to serial converter connect pin:
    J2-60 - TX of USB to serial converter
    J2-59 - RX of USB to serial converter 
    J2-70 - GND of USB to serial converter

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a MCU-LINK or JLINK with DEBUG PORT(J4) and connect a micro USB cable with USB port(J3) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer driver simple PWM demo in the terminal window:
