Overview
========

The LPCMP polling Example shows the simplest way to use LPCMP driver and help user with a quick start.

In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the 
LPCMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage about
half value of reference voltage.

When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
between logic one and zero when the user's voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() function
would detect the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED would be turned on when the compare
output is logic one, or turned off when zero.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N9XX-BRK Board
- Personal Computer
- USB to serial converter

Board settings
==============
USB to serial converter connect pin:
    J2-60 - TX of USB to serial converter
    J2-59 - RX of USB to serial converter 
    J2-70 - GND of USB to serial converter 
    
This example project uses LPCMP0 to compare the voltage signal input from channel 0(P1_0)
with the voltage signal(half of VREF_OUT) output by LPCMP's internal DAC.
The voltage signal input from P1_0 corresponding J2-4 on BRK board should be changed
to observe the dynamical IO state. You will see the red led toggle with the voltage change.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a MCU-LINK or JLINK with DEBUG PORT(J4) and connect a micro USB cable with USB port(J3) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.
