Overview
========

The lpadc_single_polling example shows the simplest way to use LPADC driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution 
would check the FIFO valid flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. 
Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.

Note, the default setting of initialization for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can change
the configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N9XX-BRK Board
- Personal Computer

- USB to serial converter

Board settings
==============
USB to serial converter connect pin:
    J2-60 - TX of USB to serial converter
    J2-59 - RX of USB to serial converter 
    J2-70 - GND of USB to serial converter 
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a MCU-LINK or JLINK with DEBUG PORT(J4) and connect a micro USB cable with USB port(J3) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.
5. The J1 Pin 70 (ADC0_A2) on BRK board is used to monitor the voltage.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.
